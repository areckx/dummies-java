		 * just fine and so I am commenting them out while I continue working through the book.
		 * While I suppose I could make a new main class for each new example class, my goal
		 * is to keep them modular. 
		 * 
		 * At the end of the book, I want to design a menu that will allow the user who runs
		 * the program to choose which class(es) to run and possibly some other nifty options
		 * I'll come up with when the time comes.
