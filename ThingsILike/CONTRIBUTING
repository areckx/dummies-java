Please use the following format for leaving comments for me to read later:

This is to facilitate regex search and replace functionality for future revisions
of my source code project.

Please note that by submitting a comment, your words will become public. I update
my project frequently and so any source code additions I `merge(approve)` will
be added into the master branch and will be subject to the LICENSE file included
in the source.

Thank you to everyone who has helped me reach to this point in my understanding of 
programming and life in general. You are a part of this project, and in some way,
shape or form, share the same values as I do. Thank you, everyone. This is our project.
