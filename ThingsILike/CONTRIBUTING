Please use the following format for leaving comments for me to read later:


    /* UserName: !NEW! <-- Pointer to anything that is a core element
     *
     */
     
List of Core Elements:

    !NEW!   <-- Something new that is important enough to point out
    !PIN!   <-- Keep this comment in source
    !TODO!  <-- Unfinished
    !FIXME! <-- Indicates something needs to be worked on, but isn't broken
    !WARN!  <-- Indicates something might be broken, but not quite broken
    !ERR!   <-- Something is broken
    !CRIT!  <-- Something is broken, and potentially poses security/hardware threats
     
This is to facilitate regex search and replace functionality for future revisions
of my source code project.

Please note that by submitting a comment, your words will become public. I update
my project frequently and so any source code additions I `merge(approve)` will
be added into the master repo and subject to the LICENSE file included in the source.

Thank you to everyone who has helped me reach to this point in my understanding of 
programming and life in general. You are a part of this project, and in some way,
shape, or form, share the same values as I do. Thank you, everyone. This is our project.
