	-- Started keeping a log of changes in a standard format

	-- Added several comments to my java code. The intent is to learn
		how to use java so that as I become used to how the code works
		I can phase it out in version changes. This entry is to always
		be the last entry, so all new entries will be inserted above
		"++ INIT ++"
